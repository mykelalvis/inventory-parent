# inventory-parent
Parent POM for inventory work

## Goals

The inventory application is a boutique project developed to handle the specific sort of personal inventory issues that I experience.  While it may be useful to other people, it was written specifically for me.  Any and all feedback will be considered, but only as it benefits the initial goal (i.e. my inventory management problem).

* Keep a list of working items
* Hold par values and rotation schedules
* Keep track of my (multiple) locations for items
* Make any item a container
* Store data in the cloud with a local (offline-capable) backup
* Allow metatagging
* Allow for software/virtual assets
